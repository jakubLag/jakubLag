# Jakub Lagierski

I am a web developer with a focus on front-end development. My journey into programming began when I was 12 years old, during my 6th grade in primary school. Over the years, I have developed a strong passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.

Currently, I am at the beginning of my career as a programmer, and I am further developing my skills as a student in a technical high school specializing in programming. I am dedicated to learning new technologies and improving my craft. My goal is to create high-quality websites that are both functional and user-friendly. I am always eager to collaborate with others and take on new challenges to further grow as a developer. [Here you can take a look at my portfolio.][jlag.pl]
